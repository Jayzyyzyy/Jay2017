/**
 Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not.
 However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.

 Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty),
 and a number n, return if n new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

 Example 1:
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
 Output: True
 Example 2:
 Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
 Output: False

 Note:
 1.The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.
 2.The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].
 3.n is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.
