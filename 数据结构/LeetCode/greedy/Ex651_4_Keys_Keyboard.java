/**
 Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

 Key 1: (Demo.A): Prints one 'Demo.A' on screen.

 Key 2: (Ctrl-Demo.A): Select the whole screen.

 Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.

 Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.

 Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the
 maximum numbers of 'Demo.A' you can print on screen.

 Example 1:

 Input: N = 3
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 We can at most get 3 Demo.A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
 Demo.A, Demo.A, Demo.A
 Example 2:

 Input: N = 7
 Output: 9
 Explanation:
 We can at most get 9 Demo.A's on screen by pressing following key sequence:
 Demo.A, Demo.A, Demo.A, Ctrl Demo.A, Ctrl C, Ctrl V, Ctrl V
 Note:

 1 <= N <= 50
 Answers will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
